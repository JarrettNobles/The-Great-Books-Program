OTHER METHODS: PRINTBOOKS: will print the book information that has been entered in the dat file

DISPLAYRECORDS: runs through the loop of books entered when you are displaying them all

PRINTDISPLAYMENU: This is the menu that runs after you have inputted book information in, it lets you view it

MENU: menu basically tells the displaymenu what to do when the user selects the 3 options

BOOKFILES: this method finds the .dat files and prints them

SORTBOOKS: is the selection sort method, sorts the books 

FINDBOOK: this method finds book titles that have been entered

CLEARSCREEN: clears the screen when changing menus, or between the beginning of the program after you have inputted information from .dat files

ENTERTOCONTINUE: lets the user run through the program at their own pace, this also runs in book display functions so the user can take their time if they need to

STARTMENU: this menu displays at the beginning of the program when you need to enter the information from .dat files, lets the user select which .dat file from the current directory they would like to use
